### Understanding the Workflow
You cannot directly connect TradingView to Zerodha. You need a middle layer—an intermediary platform or a custom-coded application—to bridge the gap. This is because TradingView sends alerts via "webhooks," which are essentially simple data packages. Your broker, Zerodha, understands orders through its own specific "API" (Application Programming Interface), in this case, the Kite Connect API.
The overall workflow looks like this:
TradingView Strategy → TradingView Alert (with Webhook) → Intermediary Platform (API Bridge) → Zerodha Kite Connect API → Order Executed
What You Will Need: The Three Key Components
1. A TradingView Pro, Pro+, or Premium Account
Why you need it: The free version of TradingView does not support webhooks, which are essential for sending automated alerts to an external service. You will need one of their paid plans to access this feature.
What it does: In your Pine Script strategy, you'll set up strategy.entry() and strategy.close() functions. You'll then create an "Alert" based on these strategy conditions. In the alert settings, you'll specify a Webhook URL to send the signal to your intermediary platform.
2. An Intermediary Platform (The "API Bridge")
Why you need it: This is the crucial link. This platform receives the generic webhook alert from TradingView and translates it into a specific, authorized order that Zerodha's Kite API can understand and execute.
What it does:
Provides you with a unique Webhook URL to paste into your TradingView alert settings.
Connects to your Zerodha account using the Kite Connect API keys.
Parses the alert message from TradingView to determine the instrument, quantity, order type (buy/sell), etc.
Constructs and sends a valid order to Zerodha for execution.
Examples of such platforms: There are several third-party platforms that offer this service, such as AlgoTest, Nextlevelbot, and others that you can find with a quick search for "TradingView to Zerodha API bridge." These platforms typically have a subscription fee.
3. A Zerodha Account with Kite Connect API Access
Why you need it: This gives you programmatic access to your own Zerodha trading account. The intermediary platform will use this API to place trades on your behalf.
What you need to do:
Subscribe to the Kite Connect API: This is a paid service from Zerodha. You can subscribe to it from the Kite Developer console.
Create an "App": In the Kite Connect developer section, you'll create an app. This will generate an api_key and an api_secret.
Provide the API keys to the intermediary platform: You will need to securely input your api_key and api_secret into the configuration settings of your chosen API bridge platform. This authorizes it to access your Zerodha account.
Step-by-Step Guide to Automating Your Strategy
Finalize Your Pine Script Strategy: Ensure your strategy is robust and has clear entry and exit signals.
Choose and Set Up an API Bridge Platform:
Research and select a third-party platform that connects TradingView to Zerodha.
Sign up and subscribe to their service.
Activate and Configure the Kite Connect API:
Go to the Zerodha Developers Console and subscribe to the Kite Connect API.
Create a new "app" to get your api_key and api_secret.
Securely enter these keys into your chosen API bridge platform's settings to link your Zerodha account.
Configure the Alert in TradingView:
On your TradingView chart, create an alert for your strategy.
In the "Alert Actions" section, enable the Webhook URL option.
Your API bridge platform will provide you with a unique URL. Paste this URL into the webhook field.
The platform will also provide you with a specific JSON message format. You must paste this message into the "Message" box of your TradingView alert. This JSON tells the bridge platform what you want to trade. It typically looks something like this (the exact format will depend on the platform you choose):
{
  "symbol": "{{ticker}}",
  "quantity": "1",
  "transaction_type": "BUY",
  "order_type": "MARKET"
}


Activate and Test:
Once everything is configured, set your alert to active in TradingView.
It's highly recommended to first test your setup with a very small quantity or in a paper trading environment if the bridge platform offers it.
When your strategy's condition is met, TradingView will trigger the alert, send the webhook to the bridge, which will then place the order on Zerodha.
Important Considerations and Disclaimers
Costs: Be aware of the recurring costs: TradingView Pro subscription + API Bridge platform subscription + Zerodha Kite API fees.
Risks of Automated Trading: You are fully responsible for the trades your algorithm places. Errors in your script, platform downtime, or API issues can lead to significant losses. Always monitor your automated strategies closely.
Zerodha's Stance: While Zerodha provides the Kite Connect API, they maintain a cautious position on fully automated trading for retail clients. Using an API for automation is generally allowed, but you should always adhere to their terms of service and usage policies.
Technical Complexity: While the bridge platforms simplify the process, a basic understanding of how APIs and webhooks work is beneficial for troubleshooting.
By following these steps, you can successfully bridge your TradingView Pine Script strategy with the Zerodha platform for automated trade execution.
