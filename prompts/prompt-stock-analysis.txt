I want build an automatic stock trading application with agentic ai, with an objective of minimizing losses and maximizing profits, I have an account with Zerodha stock broker and I want to make use of open source agentic framework like LangGraph and base my LLM on open source, for compute i want make use of groq, help me build the application in the following methodology

1. Provide the stock analysis steps like given a stock symbol 
	a. should do fundamental analysis if the stock is fundamentally strong 
	b. should determine if this price is apt to buy 
	c. if the price is right then buy the stock
	
2. For a list of stocks in portfolio
	a. determine if the stock current price trend over a longer period is going up or going down
	b. Cap the loss on a stock to 5% of the original buying price 
	c. Sell the stock if a profit of 20% is realized

(1) Research the architecture and common patterns for building agentic AI applications for algorithmic trading, specifically focusing on how frameworks like LangGraph can be utilized for decision-making and task orchestration in a trading context.
(2) Investigate open-source Large Language Models (LLMs) that are suitable for financial analysis, including their capabilities for processing financial news, reports, and market data to assist in fundamental analysis and sentiment assessment.
(3) Explore the integration of Groq for accelerating inference of open-source LLMs in a real-time trading environment, understanding its benefits and implementation considerations.
(4) Identify methods and data sources for performing fundamental analysis of stocks, including key financial metrics, ratios, and qualitative factors that an AI agent would need to evaluate to determine a stock's strength and an optimal buying price.
(5) Research techniques for technical analysis to determine long-term stock price trends, focusing on indicators and methodologies that can be automated to assess whether a stock's current price trend is upward or downward.
(6) Understand the programmatic interfaces and APIs provided by Zerodha for executing trades (buy/sell), retrieving real-time stock prices, and accessing portfolio information, including any specific requirements for authentication and rate limits.
(7) Develop a strategy for implementing the specified risk management rules: capping losses at 5% of the original buying price and realizing profits at 20%, detailing how these conditions would be monitored and triggered within an automated trading system.
(8) Synthesize all gathered information to outline a comprehensive methodology for building the automatic stock trading application, integrating the agentic AI framework, open-source LLM, Groq compute, Zerodha API, and the defined stock analysis and portfolio management rules.
