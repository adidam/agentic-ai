✅ Strategy Outline: Automated Trading with Agentic AI
🎯 Goal
Start capital: ₹10,000

Objective: Consistently generate ~₹1,000–2,000/month to cover infra costs

Constraints: Risk-controlled, fully automated, low manual monitoring

🧩 System Components
1. Market Interface
Broker API: Zerodha Kite Connect (or alternatives like Fyers, AliceBlue)

Data Feed: Free for end-of-day; use broker’s live feed for intraday

Orders: Use GTT for delivery or bracket orders with SL for intraday

2. Agentic AI Controller
Built on top of OpenAI or Groq LLMs (e.g., GPT-4-turbo or LLaMA 3 API)

Role: Interprets strategy, monitors positions, makes decisions

Add a memory component (e.g., Redis or SQLite) to retain context across runs

3. Strategy Module
Here’s where you start simple but smart:

Strategy	Risk	Notes
Supertrend-based intraday	Low	Use on Nifty or high-volume stocks
Mean reversion	Low	Good for sideways days
Option selling (if margin permits)	Moderate	Can start small with spreads

✅ Start with Supertrend + RSI filter + position sizing logic

4. Agent Prompts (example)
Use GPT to:

Evaluate today's price pattern (via chart/image or CSV)

Reason about risk:reward

Decide entry/exit with reasoning trace

Prompt example:

“You are a cautious trading agent. Based on this CSV of 5-min candles and Supertrend output, suggest whether to enter a position in Nifty with ₹500 risk, keeping max drawdown under ₹2,000 total.”

You can chain this using LangChain or use plain Python → API calls.

🧠 Smart Ways to Use Agentic AI
Trade Journal Evaluation: Let GPT analyze your past trades and suggest behavioral corrections

Simulated Inner Monologue: Run multi-agent debate between "cautious" and "aggressive" agent

Strategy Tuner: Ask the LLM to generate new strategy variations based on market behavior

🛠️ Infra Plan
Component	Tool	Cost
Hosting backend	AWS Lambda (free tier or ₹150/mo)	Minimal
Scheduling	CloudWatch or external cron (e.g. GitHub Actions)	Free
DB/logs	SQLite (or S3)	Free/cheap
AI API (backup)	GPT-4-turbo or Groq	₹1,000/mo max initially

➡️ Break-even target: ₹30–₹70 daily profit to cover API + hosting

🧪 Phased Plan
Month 1–2: Prototype & Dry Run
Setup broker integration, logging, risk control

Run backtests + paper trade with AI decision logs

Month 3–4: Live Deployment with ₹2,000
Run live trades in safe mode

Agent feedback loop (“Why did this trade succeed/fail?”)

Month 5–6: Scale to ₹10,000, Add Multi-Agent Planning
One agent tracks momentum

One agent monitors macro news sentiment (ChatGPT+RSS)

One agent handles capital allocation

⚠️ Risk Control & Reality Check
Even ₹1,000/month from ₹10,000 capital = 10% monthly, which is aggressive.

So:

Use fixed % risk per trade (e.g., 1–2%)

Target low volatility, high probability strategies

Let the agent learn from mistakes, not just successes
