In this work, we investigate the effect of\\ndropping MLP and attention layers at inference time on the performance of\\nLlama-v2 models. We find that dropping dreeper attention layers only marginally\\ndecreases performance but leads to the best speedups alongside dropping entire\\nlayers. For example, removing 33\\\\% of attention layers in a 13B Llama2 model\\nresults in a 1.8\\\\% drop in average performance over the OpenLLM benchmark. We\\nalso observe that skipping layers except the latter layers reduces performances\\nfor more layers skipped, except for skipping the attention layers.\""],"application/vnd.google.colaboratory.intrinsic+json":{"type":"string"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":9}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["tools=[wiki_tool]"],"metadata":{"id":"M_6szJrxEF89","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1747767598513,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":6,"user":{"displayName":"Sai Jyothi","userId":"07582785899082092477"}}},"execution_count":10,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["from langgraph.graph.message import add_messages\n","\n","class State(TypedDict):\n","  messages:Annotated[list,add_messages]"],"metadata":{"id":"kA7vijctESS_","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1747767687544,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":9,"user":{"displayName":"Sai Jyothi","userId":"07582785899082092477"}}},"execution_count":11,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["from langgraph.graph import StateGraph, START, END\n","\n","graph_builder=StateGraph(State)"],"metadata":{"id":"UUO7TY0jEry5","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1747767817217,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":11,"user":{"displayName":"Sai Jyothi","userId":"07582785899082092477"}}},"execution_count":12,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["from langchain_groq import ChatGroq\n","\n","llm=ChatGroq(model=\"gpt-3.5-turbo\")"],"metadata":{"id":"6EaKECsgFHoh"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
